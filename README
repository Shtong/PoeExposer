PoeExposer
==========

What
----

PoeExposer is a simple website that can be used to share your *Path of Exile* (PoE) character to the internets. 
It copies your character data from the PoE servers (with your help) to present it in an interface more optimized for **build analysis** rather than in-game artistic fidelity.

You can't visit the website yet, as it is not ready :(

PoeExposer is an open-source project, and I plan to accept contributions once the first version will be made available.
The source code is MIT-licenced.
